I've setup the frontend. Got logging-in working but still need to give an error message if necessary. The Main Component
is setup up. Top Nav Items go where they should, more or less. Need to figure out side-nav. 
Maybe best to setup other roles and permissions first. 
# TODO Backend - setup other roles and permissions to test menu in Main Component.
# TODO Frontend - handle errors in logging in.
