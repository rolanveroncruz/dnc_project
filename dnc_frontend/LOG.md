I've setup the frontend. Got logging-in working but still need to give an error message if necessary. The Main Component
is setup up. Top Nav Items go where they should, more or less. Need to figure out side-nav. 
Maybe best to setup other roles and permissions first. 
# TODO Backend - setup other roles and permissions to test menu in Main Component.
# TODO Frontend - handle errors in logging in.

Routing has been setup properly. Navigating inside setup is ok so far.
Next need to work on logging-in properly. This means the API upon successful log-in should return a menu-activation object,
and the navigation items should be activated or deactivated accordingly. Also if login fails, an error message should be displayed.
